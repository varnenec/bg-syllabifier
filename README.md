# bg-syllabifier
Prototype implementation of a syllabifier for Bulgarian

Note: this is a quick-and-dirty prototype and needs a lot of work. I've put it up to share the code with a few collaborators on a project.
It's not ready yet for pull requests, collaboration, etc. Things will be changing possibly significantly.
